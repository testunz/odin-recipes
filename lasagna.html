        <li>2 garlic cloves (minced)
        </li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the meat sauce:
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté the chopped onion and minced garlic until soft and fragrant. Add the ground meat and cook until browned. Stir in the tomato sauce, season with salt and pepper, and let it simmer for 20-30 minutes over low heat.</li>
        <li>Make the ricotta mixture:
            In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with a pinch of nutmeg (if desired), salt, and pepper. For extra flavor, you can also mix in a bit of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna:
            Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna sheets, followed by more meat sauce, a layer of ricotta mixture, and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a top layer of meat sauce and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna:
            Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Rest and serve:
            Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves for a final touch, and enjoy!</li>

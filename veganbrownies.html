        <li>1/2 cup (60 g) cocoa powder (unsweetened)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder

        <li>1/2 tsp salt

        <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) vegetable oil or melted coconut oil
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) plant-based milk (such as almond, oat, or soy)

        </li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract

        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup (90 g) vegan chocolate chips or chopped dark chocolate
        </li>
        <li>Optional: 1/4 cup (30 g) chopped nuts (like walnuts or almonds)

        </li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven:
            Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and line an 8x8-inch (20x20 cm) baking pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it.</li>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients:
            In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients:
            Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the vegetable oil, plant-based milk, and vanilla extract. Stir until the batter is smooth and no dry spots remain.
        </li>
            <li>Fold in chocolate chips and nuts:
            Gently fold in the vegan chocolate chips and, if desired, the chopped nuts for added texture.
        </li>
        <li>Bake the brownies:
            Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it out evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).
            
            </li>
            <li>Cool and serve:
                Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for at least 15 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice into squares and enjoy!
                
                </li>
